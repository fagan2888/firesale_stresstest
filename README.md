# Code for: Foundations of System-Wide Stress Testing.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rht/bank_contagion/master)

Note: This is a simplified version that only retains a fire sale contagion model, but retains the generality of the comprehensive system-wide stress test model.

By: J. Doyne Farmer, Alissa M. Kleinnijenhuis, Paul Nahai-Williamson, and Thom Wetzer.

The model.py file is a hybrid source code - Jupyter notebook.
There are 3 experiments so far.
1. Effect of price impact on systemic risk
2. Effect of initial shock on systemic risk
3. Difference between leverage targeting and threshold model (Cont-Schaanning 2017)
